## Overview

Our platform is an online betting site that offers a variety of games, including Dice, Slots, Flip, and others. Users can connect their wallets to participate in these games, place bets, and manage their funds directly through the site.

## Current Functionality

- Integration with the Solana blockchain.
- Users can connect their Phantom wallet to interact with the platform.
- Users can play Dice, Slots, Flip, and other betting games using their connected wallet.
- The platform processes bets and payouts securely on the Solana blockchain.

## Expansion Requirements

We are expanding the functionality to also work on the Ethereum and BNB chains. The requirements include:

1. **Multi-Chain Support**: Extend support to include Ethereum and BNB chains in addition to Solana.
2. **Wallet Integration**: Add support for MetaMask wallet to enable users to connect using Ethereum and BNB, while maintaining the current Phantom wallet connectivity for Solana users.
3. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: Ensure that the betting functionalities work seamlessly across Solana, Ethereum, and BNB chains.

## Games

- **Dice**: A classic betting game where users bet on the outcome of dice rolls.
- **Slots**: A slot machine game where users spin to match symbols for a payout.
- **Flip**: A coin flip game where users bet on the outcome of a coin toss.
- **Other Games**: Additional betting games providing various betting experiences.

## Wallet Integration

- **Phantom Wallet**: Currently integrated for Solana users.
- **MetaMask Wallet**: To be integrated for Ethereum and BNB users.

## Security and Transactions

- Ensure secure processing of bets and payouts on all supported blockchains.
- Implement robust security measures to protect user funds and data.
